1. Create a Sample Table with Data
Before implementing string functions, let's create a sample table and insert some
values.
CREATE TABLE employees (
id INT PRIMARY KEY,
name VARCHAR(100),
department VARCHAR(50),
email VARCHAR(100)
);
INSERT INTO employees (id, name, department, email)
VALUES (1, 'Alice Johnson', 'HR',
'alice.johnson@example.com'),
(2, 'Bob Smith', 'IT', 'bob.smith@example.com'),
(3, 'Charlie Brown', 'Finance', 'charlie.brown@example.com');
2. UPPER() - Convert to Uppercase
Definition: Converts a string to uppercase.
Example: Convert employee names to uppercase.
SELECT UPPER(name) AS upper_name FROM employees;
3. LOWER() - Convert to Lowercase
Definition: Converts a string to lowercase.
Example: Convert employee emails to lowercase.
SELECT LOWER(email) AS lower_email FROM employees;
4. LENGTH() - Find Length of a String
Definition: Returns the number of characters in a string.
Example: Find the length of each employee's name.
SELECT name, LENGTH(name) AS name_length FROM employees
5. SUBSTRING() - Extract Part of a String
Definition: Extracts a substring from a string.
Example: Extract the first 5 characters from employee names. SELECT
name, SUBSTRING(name, 1, 5) AS name_part FROM employees;
6. CONCAT() - Concatenate Strings
Definition: Combines two or more strings.
Example: Concatenate employee name and department.
SELECT CONCAT(name, ' - ', department) AS full_info FROM employees;
7. REPLACE() - Replace Substring in a String
Definition: Replaces occurrences of a substring within a
string. Example: Replace '.' with '-' in email addresses.
SELECT email, REPLACE(email, '.', '-') AS modified_email FROM employees;
8. TRIM() - Remove Leading and Trailing Spaces
Definition: Removes spaces from the beginning and end of a
string. Example: Trim spaces from employee names.
SELECT name, TRIM(name) AS trimmed_name FROM employees;
9. LEFT() - Get Left Part of a String
Definition: Extracts a specified number of characters from the
left. Example: Get the first 3 characters of employee names.
SELECT name, LEFT(name, 3) AS left_part FROM employees;
10. RIGHT() - Get Right Part of a String
Definition: Extracts a specified number of characters from the
right. Example: Get the last 3 characters of employee names.
SELECT name, RIGHT(name, 3) AS right_part FROM employees;
