1. Create Sample Tables with Data
Before working with views, let's create a sample table and insert values.
CREATE TABLE employees (
id INT PRIMARY KEY,
name VARCHAR(100),
department VARCHAR(50),
salary INT
);
INSERT INTO employees (id, name, department, salary)
VALUES (1, 'Alice Johnson', 'HR', 50000),
(2, 'Bob Smith', 'IT', 60000),
(3, 'Charlie Brown', 'Finance', 70000),
(4, 'David Miller', 'IT', 55000);
2. Creating a Simple View
Definition: A view is a virtual table that is based on the result of a
query. Example: Create a view for IT department employees.
CREATE VIEW IT_Employees AS
SELECT id, name, salary FROM employees WHERE department =
'IT'; Query the View:
SELECT * FROM IT_Employees;
3. Creating a View with Aggregation
Example: Create a view to get the average salary of employees by
department.
CREATE VIEW Avg_Salary AS
SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
Query the View:
SELECT * FROM Avg_Salary;
4. Updating Data through a View
Example: Update an employeeâ€™s salary using a view.
UPDATE IT_Employees SET salary = 62000 WHERE id =
2; Check the update:
SELECT * FROM IT_Employees;
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE id = 2;
(Note: Not all views are updatable; it depends on their complexity.)
5. Dropping a View
Example: Drop the IT_Employees view.
DROP VIEW IT_Employees;
