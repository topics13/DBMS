• Simple select clause
• Accessing specific data with Where Clause
• Ordered By/ Distinct/Group By Clause
1. Simple SELECT Clause
Step 1:
Suppose we have a table named Employees with the following data:

Step 2: To get all the columns from the Employees table: SELECT
* FROM Employees;
This will return all columns for all rows.

Step 3: To retrieve specific columns (e.g., Name and Department):
SELECT Name, Department FROM Employees

2. Accessing Specific Data with WHERE Clause
Step 1: Let's use the same Employees table.

Step 2: If we want to find employees who work in the HR department:
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Department = 'HR';

Step 3: You can use multiple conditions to filter. For example, to find
employees who are in the HR department and are older than 30:
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Department =
'HR' AND Age > 30;

3. ORDER BY / DISTINCT / GROUP BY Clauses
a) ORDER BY Clause
Step 1: Let's retrieve all employees sorted by their Age in ascending
order:
SELECT * FROM Employees ORDER BY Age ASC;

Step 2: To sort by Age in descending order:
SELECT * FROM Employees ORDER BY Age DESC;

b) DISTINCT Clause
Step 1: If we want to get a list of distinct departments:
SELECT DISTINCT Department FROM Employees;

Step 2: If you want distinct combinations of Department and Age:
SELECT DISTINCT Department, Age FROM Employees;

c) GROUP BY Clause
Step 1: To count how many employees are in each department:
SELECT Department, COUNT(*) FROM Employees
GROUP BY Department

Step 2: If we want to find the average age of employees in each
department:

SELECT Department, AVG(Age) FROM Employees
GROUP BY Department;

Step 3: If we want to apply a condition to grouped data (e.g., departments with
more than one employee):
SELECT Department, COUNT(*)
FROM Employees
GROUP BY Department
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
