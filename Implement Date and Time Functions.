1. Create a Sample Table with Data
Before implementing date and time functions, let's create a sample table and insert
some values.
CREATE TABLE employees (
id INT PRIMARY KEY,
name VARCHAR(100),
join_date DATE,
last_login TIMESTAMP
);
INSERT INTO employees (id, name, join_date, last_login)
VALUES (1, 'Alice Johnson', '2022-01-15', '2024-03-25 14:30:00'),
(2, 'Bob Smith', '2021-06-10', '2024-03-25 09:15:00'),
(3, 'Charlie Brown', '2023-09-05', '2024-03-24 18:45:00');
2. CURRENT_DATE() - Get Current Date
Definition: Returns the current date.
Example:
SELECT CURRENT_DATE() AS today_date;
3. CURRENT_TIME() - Get Current Time
Definition: Returns the current time.
Example:
SELECT CURRENT_TIME() AS current_time;
4. NOW() - Get Current Date and Time
Definition: Returns the current date and time.
Example:
SELECT NOW() AS current_datetime;
5. DATE() - Extract Date from Timestamp
Definition: Extracts the date portion from a timestamp.
Example: Extract join date from last login timestamp.
SELECT name, DATE(last_login) AS login_date FROM employees;
6. TIME() - Extract Time from Timestamp
Definition: Extracts the time portion from a timestamp.
Example: Extract login time from last login timestamp.
SELECT name, TIME(last_login) AS login_time FROM employees;
7. YEAR(), MONTH(), DAY() - Extract Year, Month, and Day
Definition: Extracts specific parts of a date.
Example: Get the year, month, and day from the join date.
SELECT name, YEAR(join_date) AS join_year, MONTH(join_date) AS join_month,
DAY(join_date) AS join_day FROM employees;
8. HOUR(), MINUTE(), SECOND() - Extract Time
Components Definition: Extracts hour, minute, and second
from a timestamp.
Example: Get hour, minute, and second from the last login time.
SELECT name, HOUR(last_login) AS login_hour, MINUTE(last_login) AS
login_minute, SECOND(last_login) AS login_second FROM employees;
9. DATE_ADD() - Add Interval to a Date
Definition: Adds a specified interval to a date.
Example: Add 30 days to the join date.
SELECT name, join_date, DATE_ADD(join_date, INTERVAL 30 DAY) AS new_date
FROM employees;
10. DATEDIFF() - Difference Between Two Dates
Definition: Returns the number of days between two dates.
Example: Calculate the number of days an employee has been in the company.
SELECT name, DATEDIFF(CURRENT_DATE(), join_date) AS days_in_company
FROM employees;
11. TIMEDIFF() - Difference Between Two Time Values
Definition: Returns the difference between two time values.
Example: Calculate the difference between the current time and last login.
SELECT name, TIMEDIFF(NOW(), last_login) AS time_since_login FROM
employees;
12. STR_TO_DATE() - Convert String to Date
Definition: Converts a string into a date format.
Example: Convert a string into a date format.
SELECT STR_TO_DATE('25-03-2024', '%d-%m-%Y') AS converted_date;
13. DATE_FORMAT() - Format Date Output
Definition: Formats a date in a specific format.
Example: Display join date in 'DD/MM/YYYY' format.
SELECT name, DATE_FORMAT(join_date, '%d/%m/%Y') AS formatted_date FROM
employees;
